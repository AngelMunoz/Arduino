Solid.Arduino
=============

This is a software library implementing commonly used protocols for Arduino.
Its purpose is making communication with Arduino boards in MS .NET projects easier
through a comprehensive and consistent set of methods and events.

The project's goal is to support the following protocols:
1. Serial (ASCII) messaging protocol
2. MIDI protocol
3. Firmata protocol
4. I2C protocol (as it has become part of Firmata)

Technology used: Microsoft .NET/C# v4.5

Current status
==============
Mainly a lot of work in progress. (Pre-alpha draft)

Milestones
==========
1. Firmata protocol largely implemented and tested.
2. I2C protocol implemented (but not yet tested).
